# thainsbook

> The Thain's Book is the expanded copy of the original Red Book of Westmarch in the Lord of the Rings Universe. It is the hobbit manuscript containing the stories of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, written and compiled by Bilbo, Frodo, and Samwise Gamgee, then augmented in Gondor.

Just as the Thain's Book is the treasured historical record in the Shire, thainsbook is the treasured record of your life. It is my Go server for any and all journalling needs.
